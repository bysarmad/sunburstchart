# sunburstchart
This template lets you visualize a user's journey through a product using a sunburst chart. A sunburst chart visualizes hierarchical data spanning outwards radially from root to leaves. The sunburst sector hierarchy is determined by the path taken. The root starts from the center and children are added to the outer rings.
